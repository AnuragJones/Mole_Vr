# Mole_Vr
A virtual reality game based on the famous arcade game "Whack-a-Mole.
This Project is a virtual reality game based on the famous arcade game, "Whack-a-Mole". The game was made using a software called unity by adding various 3d objects to resemble the moles along with scripts that guide the movement of the mole when they are hit by the player and their speed and position in general. The basic layout of the game and camera set up was made through unity and the the design of the enviornment and the arcade machines were all made using, Blender. The models made in blender were carefully thought out too give of an aesthetic vibe of an arcade so that player feels interested. The models were then converted into an fbx file to be imported into unity, where the final touch ups such as the positioning of the enviornment with the player view, etc. In the end a very simple Background Audio was added to enhance the experience just a little more.
